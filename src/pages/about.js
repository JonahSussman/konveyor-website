                Red Hat is announcing the launch of the StackRox community at
                KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe. This community will aim to
                develop the industryâ€™s leading open source Kubernetes-native
                security solution. A new community site at stackrox.io is being
                launched concurrently with the announcement to enable interested
                end users and organizations to participate in development and
                related activities. The site will also make available relevant
                content and resources on various topics related to Kubernetes
                security.
              </AccordionItem>
              <AccordionItem title="What will the StackRox project do?">
                The StackRox project will provide the broader cloud-native
                community with an open solution for Kubernetes-native security
                that enables users to build, deploy, and run cloud-native
                applications anywhere. It will enable users to address all
                significant security use cases across the entire application
                lifecycle, including visibility, vulnerability management,
                configuration management, network segmentation, compliance,
                threat detection and incident response, and risk profiling.
              </AccordionItem>
              <AccordionItem title="Why is this being announced now?">
                An open development model is core to Red Hat. Additionally, we
                believe that this model can drive significant innovation and
                benefits for end users when it comes to security, an industry
                with many solutions that have closed codebases. Security
                continues to be a critical need for the broader cloud-native
                community building and running Kubernetes applications. The
                StackRox community can work toward providing a new open source
                solution that gives end users greater choice for how they
                protect their Kubernetes environments.
              </AccordionItem>
              <AccordionItem title="Will there be any collaboration with any other projects and/or communities? Which ones?">
                Yes, as part of open sourcing the StackRox software, Red Hat
                will contribute to open source projects that the StackRox
                software benefits from and participate as active members of the
                communities that support those projects.
              </AccordionItem>
              <AccordionItem title="Will there still be a commercial offering of the StackRox software?">
                The commercial StackRox offering has been rebranded as Red Hat
                Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS). Going forward,
                once open sourced, StackRox will be the primary upstream project
                that powers RHACS (in addition to other open source projects).
              </AccordionItem>
              <AccordionItem title="Will any other open source projects be included? What open source code can an end-user use today?">
                The StackRox community will also encompass and continue to
                foster the development of KubeLinter, which was released as an
                open source project in October 2020. KubeLinter is a static
                analysis tool that enables developers to easily check Kubernetes
                YAML files and Helm charts to identify misconfigurations and
                enforce security best practices.
